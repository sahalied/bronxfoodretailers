          Food insecurity has a direct correlation with the number of grocery stores and food retailers located in a community. This issue is prevalent across all of New York City, but people living in the Bronx are particularly impacted, according
          to Shana McCormick, Rap4Bronx coordinator.
        </p>

        <p>
          She described food insecurity as a “pre-existing condition” in the Bronx, where affordable grocery stores can be scarce. Even within the Bronx, inequalities exist. Neighborhoods located on the outskirts of the Bronx such as Mott Haven and
          Hunts Point have even fewer retailers than neighborhoods like Fordham.

          “There’s a lot of food swamps and food deserts within and throughout the Bronx. For instance you can walk a ten block radius and you have maybe a couple of fast food restaurants and no access to healthy food within that frame,” McCormick
          said. “It’s obviously an impoverished area.”
